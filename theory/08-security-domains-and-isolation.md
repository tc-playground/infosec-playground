# Security Domains

## Introduction

1. Security requirements `availability`, `security`, `privacy`, `anonymity` , and are often __conflicting__.

    * There are often `trade-offs` that are impossible to accomplish in `a single environment` e.g. Gaming vs Full-disk Encryption.

2. Security can split over several `security domain` with each one tailored to the required security needs.

    * Run dual boot laptop without full disk-encryption; run VMs with full-disk encryption inside for secure operations.

3. `Security domain`s can be either:

    1. `Physical` - e.g. Have a separate machines for tasks A and B.

    2. `Virtual (Isolation)` - e.g. User VMs or containers for tasks A and B.
